This folder implements for the following work:
Wu, Baoyuan and Lyu, Siwei and Ghanem, Bernard. 
"Constrained Submodular Minimization for Missing Labels and Class Imbalance in Multi-label Learning", AAAI 2016


It includes:
1 -- A demo based on Emotions dataset. 
2 -- matlab codes of our method (MMIB), evaluation metrics and two toolboxes 
    2.1 -- 'vlfeat-0.9.19' is used to compute the example similarity based on kd-tree, and it is downloaded from 'http://www.vlfeat.org/'
	2.2 -- 'st-mincut' is used to implement the st-cut method, and it is originally downloaded as 'BK_matlab.zip' from http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/
	
3 -- The dataset Emotions is downloaded from the Mulan data 'http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html' 
	 -- For other datasets reported in our paper, you can find the download link from our paper. 

	 
Note: the current implementation of our method 'MMIB.m' will be further accelerated in the near future. 

If you have used the code, Please cite the following work.
